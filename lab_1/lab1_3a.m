A = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1; 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0; 1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0; ...
    0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1; 0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0; 1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0; ...
    0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1; 0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0; 1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0; ...
    0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0; 1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1; 0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0];

b = [13;15;8;14.79;14.31;3.81;18;12;6;10.51;16.13;7.04];

% using rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12
% matrix A has rank 9
A9 = [A(1:2, :); A(4:5, :); A(7:8, :); A(10:12, :)];
b9 = [b(1:2, 1); b(4:5, 1); b(7:8, 1); b(10:12, :)];

x = A9\b9;

%I do not think this solution is better, I have tried many 9-row combinations and they give me different answers.
